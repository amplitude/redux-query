`redux-query` is a library for querying and managing network state in React/Redux applications.

With `redux-query` you can:

- Declare your network dependencies right next to your React components. Data is requested automatically when components mount. When components update and unmount, in-flight requests are automatically cancelled.
- Trigger server-side changes (mutations) by dispatching regular Redux actions.
- Have a consistent, minimal-boilerplate interface for all network-related state.
- Transform and normalize data to avoid duplicate state.
- Perform optimistic updates.
- Use with other Redux middleware libraries like [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).
- Debug network state and actions with Redux dev tools like [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger).

## Getting Started

Install `redux-query` via npm:

```
$ npm install --save redux-query
```

Add the `entitiesReducer` and `queriesReducer` to your combined reducer.

Include the `queryMiddleware` in your store's `applyMiddleware` call. `queryMiddleware` requires two arguments: a selector (or function) that returns entities state, and a function for the queries state.

For example:

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { entitiesReducer, queriesReducer, queryMiddleware } from 'redux-query';
import createLogger from 'redux-logger';

export const getQueries = (state) => state.queries;
export const getEntities = (state) => state.entities;

const reducer = combineReducers({
    entities: entitiesReducer,
    queries: queriesReducer,
});

const logger = createLogger();
const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    applyMiddleware(queryMiddleware(getQueries, getEntities), logger)
);
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in [`package.json`](./package.json). Redux and React are peer dependencies. HTTP requests are made using [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent).

## Usage and API

### Requests and mutations

There are two types of queries with `redux-query`: "requests" and "mutations". Requests are for reading values from HTTP endpoints. Mutations are for HTTP endpoints that change network state â€“ the "C", "U", and "D" in "CRUD".

Requests can be triggered from the `connectRequest` higher-order component or a `requestAsync` action. Mutations are triggered by dispatching a `mutateAsync` action.

By default, requests are GETs and mutations are POSTS.

### Query configs

Query configs are objects used to describe how redux-query should handle the request or mutation. Query config options differ slightly between requests and mutations

#### Request query config options

| Name | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| `url` | string | yes | The URL for the HTTP request. |
| `transform` | function |  | Function that transforms the response data to an entities object where keys are entity IDs and values are entity data. Can be used to normalize data. |
| `update` | object | yes | Object where keys are entity IDs and values are update functions. |
| `body` | object |  | The request body. |
| `force` | boolean |  | Perform the request even if we've already successfully requested it. |
| `queryKey` | string |  | The identifier used to identify the query metadata in the `queries` reducer. If unprovided, the `url` and `body` fields are serialized to generate the query key. |
| `meta` | object |  | Various metadata for the query. Can be used to update other reducers when queries succeed or fail. |
| `options` | object |  | Options for the request. Set `options.method` to change the HTTP method, `options.headers` to set any headers and `options.credentials = 'include'` for CORS. |

#### Mutation query config options

| Name | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| `url` | string | yes | The URL for the HTTP request. |
| `transform` | function |  | Function that transforms the response data to an entities object where keys are entity IDs and values are entity data. Can be used to normalize data. |
| `update` | object | yes | Object where keys are entity IDs and values are update functions. |
| `optimisticUpdate` | object |  | Object where keys are entity IDs and values are functions that provide the current entity value. The return values are used to update the `entities` store until the mutation finishes. |
| `body` | object |  | The HTTP request body. |
| `queryKey` | string |  | The identifier used to identify the query metadata in the `queries` reducer. If unprovided, the `url` and `body` fields are serialized to generate the query key. |
| `meta` | object |  | Various metadata for the query. Can be used to update other reducers when queries succeed or fail. |
| `options` | object |  | Options for the request. Set `options.method` to change the HTTP method, `options.headers` to set any headers and `options.credentials = 'include'` for CORS. |

### `transform` functions

`transform` functions let you process and normalize response data before it is passed to the `update` step. They have the following signature:

```javascript
(responseJson: ?Object, responseText: string) => { [key: string]: any }
```

If your data is normalized on the server, you may not need to use this function.

### `update` functions

`update` functions are responsible for reconciling response data with the existing `entities` reducer data for the given entity ID. They have the following signature:

```javascript
(prevValue: any, transformedValue: any) => any
```

The `prevValue` is the whatever value is selected from the `entities` reducer for the respective entity ID. The returned value from this function will become the new value for the entity ID in the `entities` reducer.

### `optimisticUpdate` functions

`optimisticUpdate` functions are just like update functions except they only pass the `prevValue`:

```javascript
(prevValue: any) => any
```

### `connectRequest`

Use the `connectRequest` higher-order component to declare network dependencies for a React component. `connectRequest` takes a function that transforms the component `props` to a request query config or an array of request query configs. Example usage:

```javascript
import { connectRequest } from 'redux-query';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class Dashboard extends Component {
    ...
}

const DashboardContainer = connectRequest((props) => ({
    url: `/api/dashboard/${props.dashboardId}`,
    update: {
        chartsById: (prevCharts, dashboardCharts) => ({
            ...prevCharts,
            ...dashboardCharts,
        }),
        dashboardsById: (prevDashboards, dashboards) => ({
            ...prevDashboards,
            ...dashboards,
        }),
    },
}))(Dashboard);

const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {
    return {
        dashboard: getDashboard(state, props),
    };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(DashboardContainer);
```

`connectRequest` passes an extra prop to the child component: `forceRequest`. Calling this function will cause the request(s) to be made again. This may be useful for polling or creating an interface to trigger refreshes.

### `mutateAsync`

Dispatch `mutateAsync` Redux actions to trigger mutations. `mutateAsync` takes a mutation query config as its only argument. Example usage with a [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)-connected component:

```javascript
// src/queries/dashboard.js

export const createUpdateDashboardQuery = (dashboardId, newName) => ({
    url: `/api/${dashboardId}/update`,
    body: {
        name: newName,
    },
    update: {
        dashboardsById: (prevDashboardsById, newDashboardsById) => ({
            ...prevDashboardsById,
            ...newDashboardsById,
        }),
    },
});

// src/actions/dashboard.js

import { mutateAsync } from 'redux-query';
import { createUpdateDashboardQuery } from '../queries/dashboard';

export const updateDashboard = (dashboardId, newName) => {
    return mutateAsync(createUpdateDashboardQuery(dashboardId, newName));
};

// src/selectors/dashboard.js

export const getDashboard = (state, { dashboardId }) => {
    if (state.entities.dashboardsById) {
        return state.entities.dashboardsById[dashboardId];
    } else {
        return null;
    }
};

// src/components/Dashboard.jsx

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import { updateDashboard } from '../actions/dashboard';
import { getDashboard } from '../selectors/dashboard';

class Dashboard extends Component {
    ...
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {
    return {
        dashboard: getDashboard(state, props),
    };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, props) => {
    return {
        changeName: (newName) => {
            dispatch(updateDashboard(props.dashboardId, newName));
        },
    };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Dashboard);
```

When dispatching a `mutateAsync` action, you can Promise-chain on the returned value from `dispatch`:

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, props) => {
    return {
        changeName: (newName) => {
            dispatch(updateDashboard(props.dashboardId, newName)).then((result) => {
                if (result.status !== 200) {
                    dispatch(showUpdateDashboardFailedNotification(props.dashboardId));
                }
            });
        },
    };
};
```

The result of the promise returned by `mutateAsync` will be the following object:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| status | number | HTTP status code.
| body | object or null | Parsed response body.
| text | string | Unparsed response body string.
| duration | number | The total duration from the start of the query to receiving the full response.
| transformed | any | Result from the transform function. Will be identical to body if transform is unprovided in the query config.
| entities | object | The new, updated entities that have been affected by the query.

### `requestAsync`

Similarly to how mutations are triggered by dispatching `mutateAsync` actions, you can trigger requests by dispatching `requestAsync` actions with a request query config.

### `redux-query/advanced` and custom network adapters

By default, `redux-query` makes XHR requests using the [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) library. If you'd rather use a different library for making requests, you can use the `redux-query`'s "advanced" mode by importing from `redux-query/advanced` instead of `redux-query`.

Note: The default [`queryMiddleware`](./src/middleware/query.js) exported from the main `redux-query` entry point is simply a [superagent adapter](./src/adapters/superagent.js) bound to `queryMiddlewareAdvanced`.

Example `queryMiddlewareAdvanced` usage:

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { entitiesReducer, queriesReducer, queryMiddlewareAdvanced } from 'redux-query/advanced';

// A function that takes a url, method, and other options. This function should return an object
// with two required properties: execute and abort.
import myNetworkAdapter from './network-adapter';

export const getQueries = (state) => state.queries;
export const getEntities = (state) => state.entities;

const reducer = combineReducers({
    entities: entitiesReducer,
    queries: queriesReducer,
});

const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    applyMiddleware(queryMiddlewareAdvanced(myNetworkAdapter)(getQueries, getEntities))
);
```

#### Network adapters

You must provide a function to `queryMiddlewareAdvanced` that adheres to the following `NetworkAdapter` interface:

```javascript
type NetworkAdapter = (
    url: string,
    method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE',
    config?: { body?: string | Object, headers?: Object, credentials?: 'omit' | 'include' } = {},
) => NetworkRequest;

type NetworkRequest = {
    execute: (callback: (err: any, resStatus: number, resBody: ?Object, resText: string, resHeaders: Object) => void) => void,
    abort: () => void,
    instance: any,
};
```

## Example

A fork of the `redux` [Async](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/async) example is included. To run, first build the package:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then you can run the example:

```sh
$ cd examples/async
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
